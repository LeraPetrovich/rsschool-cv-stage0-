### Briefly About Myself:
Hello, I'm Valeria
At the moment I am a 2nd-year student of the BSU Faculty of Radiophysics and Computer Technology. In the first year I studied the basics of C++. After studying C++, I became interested in web development.
I am a punctual and responsible person. I always do the right job on time. I quickly find a common language with the team and have intermediate interpersonal skills. I like to occupy my time with self-development. Working in a remote format will give me the opportunity to do the right job regardless of the place and time.
