### Briefly About Myself:
Hello, I'm Valeria
At the moment I am a 2nd-year student of the BSU Faculty of Radiophysics and Computer Technology. In the first year I studied the basics of C++. After studying C++, I became interested in web development.
I am a punctual and responsible person. I always do the right job on time. I quickly find a common language with the team and have intermediate interpersonal skills. I like to occupy my time with self-development. Working in a remote format will give me the opportunity to do the right job regardless of the place and time.

*********

### Skills and Proficiency:
- studied the basics of C++ at the university
- I know Java on a low level and have studied html in middle school.

### Code example:
__Task:__ The input numbers are n and m. Print the multiplication table n * m

```

import java.util.Scanner;

class MyNumber {
public static void main(String[] args) {

Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
int n = in.nextInt();
int m= in.nextInt();
int gr1[][] = new int [n+1][m+1];
String spase;
for(int i=1; i<=n;i++){
spase="";
for(int j=1;j<=m;j++){
// int gr1[i][j]=in.nextInt;
gr1[i][j]=j*i;

System.out.print(spase+gr1[i][j]);
spase=" ";

}
System.out.println();
}}}
